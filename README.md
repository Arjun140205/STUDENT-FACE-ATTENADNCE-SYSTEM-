This repository features a Face Attendance Detection System developed in Python. The system leverages the Tkinter library for an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and OpenCV for advanced real-time computer vision capabilities. By using Haarcascades for face detection, this system automates attendance tracking through facial recognition from webcam feeds.

Key Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Employs OpenCV's Haarcascades to detect and recognize faces in real-time, ensuring accurate and prompt identification.
User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, providing a straightforward interface for managing attendance processes, starting/stopping face detection, and viewing attendance logs.
Automated Attendance Logging: Automatically records the time and identity of detected faces, facilitating effortless and efficient attendance tracking.
Face Recognition: Utilizes facial recognition technology to identify and differentiate individuals, ensuring precise attendance records.
